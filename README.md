UPM (Useful Packages & Modules) Sensor/Actuator repository for MRAA
==============

UPM is a high level repository for sensors that use MRAA. Each sensor links
to MRAA and are not meant to be interlinked although some groups of sensors
may be. Each sensor contains a header which allows to interface with it.
Typically a sensor is represented as a class and instantiated.

### Install

To install a UPM module using npm simply type:

npm install jsupm_<module-name>
